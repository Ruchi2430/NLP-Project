Extract key elements from recipe text, such as ingredients, quantities, and units of measurement
The goal of this assignment is to develop a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify and extract key elements from recipe text, such as ingredients, quantities, and units of measurement. By applying this model, learners will gain a deeper understanding of how to convert unstructured recipe text into structured data. This improves recipe search engines, cooking assistants, and meal planning applications.

Business Value:
The business objective is to leverage the popularity of online cooking platforms and meal planning apps by enhancing the user experience. Implementing a custom NER model to automatically tag ingredients, quantities, and recipe names streamlines the process of organizing recipes, improves searchability, and enables users to easily find recipes based on available ingredients, portion sizes, or dietary requirements. This automation reduces the labor-intensive and inefficient manual tagging process, making it more accessible and efficient for businesses in the food and recipe industry to manage their databases.
